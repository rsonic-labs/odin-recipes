    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <p>Most lasagna recipes call for hours of simmering the tomato/meat sauce to release its flavors. This one, however, only requires 5 minutes of simmering time.</p>
    <p>How is that possible, you ask? Well, it’s simple: all you’ll need is a marinara sauce. Since it’s already packed with flavor, there’s no need to wait at all!</p>
    <p>Together with sausage or ground beef, cheeses, and lasagna noodles, it creates the most wonderful flavors and textures that are impossible to resist.</p>
    <p>It may be heavy, but trust me, you won’t be able to stop at one slice. Good thing one recipe can feed up to 12!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong> — this recipe calls for Barilla lasagna, but your favorite brand will do.</li>
            <li><strong>Marinara sauce</strong> — Again, the recipe calls for Barilla, but any high-quality and great-tasting marinara sauce works, too.</li>
            <li><strong>Bulk Italian sausage or ground beef</strong> — For that meatiness that tastes heavenly with marinara and cheese. Your meat should already be cooked and drained ahead of time. </li>
            <li><strong>Ricotta, Mozzarella, and Parmigiano-Reggiano</strong> — The trio of cheeses that makes this lasagna rich, creamy, and gooey!</li>
        </ol>
